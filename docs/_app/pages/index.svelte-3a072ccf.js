In many unsuccessful captions, the word that should appear at the very end gets buried in the middle. 3.

End with the punch line, a closing word or phrase that surprises the reader and gives the cartoon meaning. In many unsuccessful captions, the word that should appear at the very end gets buried in the middle. 3.
