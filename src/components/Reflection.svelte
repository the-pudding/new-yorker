    <p>We were hopeful that we could get GPT-3—an AI program that can shockingly produce writing that’s indistinguishable from humans—to produce a winning caption for the venerated New Yorker Cartoon Caption Contest.</p>    
</section>
<section>
    <p><span class="bolded">We were impressed by what an AI could generate. </span>Here’s one of our favorite captions authored by GPT-3.</p>

    <div class="wide-mode white">
        <img src="https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/61327f4b4bc5f041092d873b/master/w_580,c_limit/210913_a25275_771.jpg" alt="captionless cartoon by Drew Dernavich">
        <p class="caption">“Don't worry, dear. It's just the magnetism of my personality.”</p>
    </div>
    <p>What a masterpiece! Even I would be skeptical that a computer could pull off a double entendre, and we didn’t even need any special skills to generate it. Here’s the process:</p>
    <div class="wide-mode white">
        <video muted alt="Video of GPT-3 generating a caption for the cartoon of a 'A couple are sitting on a couch and surrounded by five guys who have metal detectors who are sweeping the floor around the couch, looking for metal. What is the woman saying to the man?'" src="/assets/videos/playground.mp4" controls autoplay loop></video>
    </div>
    <p>GPT-3 is an open-to-the-public tool (just create an account <a href="https://beta.openai.com/playground" target="_blank">here</a> ). The “playground” mode is just a text box. Enter some text and GPT-3 generates a response, wielding a model that’s trained on THE ENTIRE INTERNET. In this case we entered,</p>
    <p><i>“A couple are sitting on a couch and surrounded by five guys who have metal detectors who are sweeping the floor around the couch, looking for metal. What is the woman saying to the man?”</i></p>
    <p>And it responds with the caption,</p>
    <p><i>“Don't worry, dear. It's just the magnetism of my personality.”</i></p>
    <p>We could also track how our captions ranked among the New Yorker’s thousands of entries for each week’s contest. It runs a <a href="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/mlnow-newyorker/captioncontest_s3.html" target="_blank">survey</a> that prompts people with a caption and asks whether it is funny. The magazine <a href="https://nextml.github.io/caption-contest-data2/" target="_blank">publishes</a> the results and its editors then choose the finalists from the ranked list.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <p><span class="bolded">We submitted computer-generated captions for 10 different contests. One caption ranked in the top 100.</span> <span class="smaller">Captions, ranked by votes from the New Yorker’s Cartoon Caption Contest Survey</span></p>
    <div class="wide-mode">
        <LineChart />
    </div>
    <p>Each time we attempted a contest, we tweaked our approach based on how funny the captions were in our previous attempts (both based on official voting and our own instincts).</p>

    <p>We described the cartoon as objectively as possible, “A man and a woman are having a picnic in a park. The man is talking. There are anthropomorphic clouds that are angry.”</p>
    <p>The results were not that impressive, which meant we needed a more robust prompt for GPT-3 or a simpler cartoon.</p>

    <p>In 2015, former New Yorker cartoon editor Bob Mankoff <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.08126.pdf" target="_blank">released a study</a> with data scientists at Microsoft about how to detect “funniness” in reader-submitted cartoon captions. They concluded that captions related to a cartoon’s anomaly (i.e., what was odd/unique in it) mattered a lot in terms of its funniness ranking by readers. We called this experiment <a href="contest/761">Anomaly + AI = Comedy?</a></p>
    <p>We asked readers to describe the image and why it was funny. From there, we fed those descriptions into GPT-3 as the cartoon’s description.</p>

    <p>Contributor and AI-tinkerer <a href="https://twitter.com/jamesjyu">James Wu</a> helped out on this experiment, modeling a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVM7zaqw7ZU">YouTube series</a> where comedians narrate their thought process while coming up with caption ideas for the New Yorker cartoon caption contest.</p>
    <p>James fed a generic version of this script into the GPT-3 text prompt for various comedians. GPT-3 is clever enough to generate text in the style of a comedian, and he tested this process with Seinfeld, John Swartzwelder, Dave Chapelle, "a Simpsons Writer," Larry Wood, and Demetri Martin.</p>
    <p>Results were slightly better for Demetri Martin in James’ own blind voting (which makes sense—his comedy relies on deadpan one-liners), so we called this experiment <a href="contest/762">The Demetri Martin</a>.</p>

            <span>Today, we are excited to invite COMEDIAN to the stage. INSERT FACTS ABOUT COMEDIAN.<br>
                Interviewer: What would you say is the secret to a good New Yorker caption?<br>
                COMEDIAN: 1. Be brief. Although some great captions are long brevity really is the soul of wit. 2. End with the punch line, a closing word or phrase that surprises the reader and gives the cartoon meaning. In many unsuccessful captions, the word that should appear at the very end gets buried in the middle. 3. Work hard to ensure that your caption makes sense of the cartoon, either by reconciling two disparate elements or by providing a backstory, and by making sure that you know which character in the cartoon is speaking and delivering the line.<br>
                Interviewer: I have a few New Yorker cartoons here that need a caption. I was wondering if you could come up with some funny captions.<br>
                COMEDIAN: I'd be happy to try!<br>
                Interviewer: Here is the cartoon.<br>
                COMEDIAN: Okay, so in this cartoon, it looks like we're in a fire station. There are two firemen looking at the poles they slide down to get to the first floor. But each hole that the poles go down into is different: one is square and one is a circle. One of the firemen seems to be saying something to the other one.<br>
                COMEDIAN: How about this: "Since when did the pizza delivery guy get his own pole?"<br>
                Interviewer: That's funny! Insinuating that the pizza delivery guy gets the square hole because it's a pizza box shape. How about another one?<br>
                COMEDIAN: Sure: "Is the fire in Times Square or Columbus Circle?"<br>
                Interviewer: That's funny! Insinuating that there is a requirement to go down a particular hole given a location.<br>
                Interviewer: Let's move on to a new cartoon. Here it is.<br>
                COMEDIAN: Okay, in this cartoon, there are three mice running in hamster wheels. A fourth hamster wheel is empty. In front of it, a turtle is talking to a mouse who is holding a clipboard in front of the empty hamster wheel. Interesting that he is the only turtle there. It seems like the mouse is explaining something to the turtle.<br>
                COMEDIAN: How about this: "

    <p><a href="contest/762">The Demetri Martin</a> approach did very well. Priming GPT-3 with a specific comedic voice seemed to really produce strong results.</p>
    <p>Next we decided that maybe the model just needs to know what a winning caption sounds like. We gave GPT-3 a number of finalists from past contests, hoping it would use a similar type of humor. We named this experiment <a href="contest/763">The Funniest</a>.</p>

    <p>One thing we were wondering was whether the default parameters for GPT-3 were the best ones to use. We tweaked a number of things in GPT-3’s interface: temperature, presence penalty, and frequency penalty, whose values ranged from 0, to 0.3, to 0.6, to 1. We also used the “davinci” and “davinci-instruct-beta” engines. This experiment was called <a href="contest/764">Brick-By-Brick</a>.</p>
    <p>This approach didn’t seem to really improve the captions, so we decided to stick with the defaults for future experiments.</p>

    <p>One thing that we always wished GPT-3 would pick-up on was the obvious joke. In this cartoon, a predictable punchline would be related to climate change. But just describing the cartoon to GPT-3 or pointing out what was unique (i.e., the polar bear next to a tropical island) wouldn’t get us there.</p>
    <p>We adjusted the prompt to nudge GPT-3 towards the obvious joke with, “Write a funny caption about <u>global warming</u> for a cartoon.”</p>
    <p>We also added to GPT-3’s prompt a number of top-performing captions from previous contests about climate change.</p>

    <p>GPT-3 advisor <a href="https://pudding.cool/author/pamela-mishkin" target="_blank">Pamela Mishkin</a> hypothesized that using a chatbot approach might yield better results. She had used this approach in her essay <a href="https://pudding.cool/2021/03/love-and-ai/" target="_blank">Nothing Breaks Like A.I. Heart</a> and produced compelling responses. The thought was that GPT-3 wouldn’t have to answer a specific question such as, “generate a caption for a cartoon with X.” Instead, we could ask GPT-3 what it thought was funny about the scene, or what were some common themes that could be the foundation for a good joke. </p>
    <p>We first described the cartoon to GPT-3 and allowed the bot to ask questions about the cartoon. Funnily enough, it asked things like, “Do you think the dragon is winning? Is the princess crying? Is the knight bringing ice cream?”</p>
    <p>Our responses to these questions would obviously shape the dialogue, and we had a lot of fun with the back-and-forth. We responded to GPT-3 with, “I think the princess is winning. She is confident. The knight is trying to save the princess”</p>
    <p>The results were worse than our previous experiments, but the dialogues were entertaining nonetheless. Here’s an example where things got existential:</p>
    <p>Human: What would be a funny caption for a cartoon about ping pong and dragons?<br>AI: "Ping Pang: The tales they tell about a princess and her pet dragon playing ping pong.<br>Human: That's a good pun I guess.<br>AI: I'm happy to make you happy.<br>Human: My story is about dragons play ping pong? Can you think of a funny way to say what happens next?<br>AI: How about "This is the best day of my life"<br>Human: you're not very funny.<br>AI: None of my jokes are very funny</p>

    <p>We repeated the same approach from our first attempt (<a href="contests/757">The Zero-Shot</a>). But this time, we had famed former New Yorker Cartoon editor Bob Mankoff observing GPT-3 in real-time.</p>
    <p>We noticed that many of our entries were hitting the right themes from among the high-ranking captions, but just weren’t written in the clever, pithy style that’s appropriate for a cartoon.</p>
    <p>Our plan was that Bob Mankoff could take a GPT-3 generated caption, such as “He eats the books,” and tweak it to, “You know, it’d be funnier if it was, ‘he eats this stuff up.’”</p>
    <p>Mankoff also elicited a few topics that we leaned on GPT-3 to augment. He started out with the idea that alligators could be a new type of bookstore pet, so we asked GPT-3, “What are some other pets found in bookstores?”</p>
    <p>This experiment, called <a href="contest/769">The Expert</a>, was the first attempt where the caption candidates were not directly generated by GPT-3. We figured that GPT-3 assisting with captions, rather than generating them from scratch, would be a better approach to winning the contest.</p>

    <p>Bob Mankoff, former New Yorker cartoon editor, connected us with Lawrence Wood, who has won the caption contest seven times.</p>
    <p>We thought a similar exercise to the previous attempt would yield strong results with another expert caption-writer in the room.

    <p>Generally we were really impressed with the results: GPT-3 generated underwhelming captions which would then be polished into outstanding captions by Wood and Mankoff.</p>

    <p><b>How to win the New Yorker Caption Contest</b></p>
    <p><i>Phrasing Matters</i></p>
    <p>Everyone lands on the same joke angles. Here is contest #771:</p>
    <div class="wide-mode white">
        <img src="https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/61327f4b4bc5f041092d873b/master/w_580,c_limit/210913_a25275_771.jpg" alt="captionless cartoon by Drew Dernavich">
    </div>
    <p>The most-common jokes were about:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Finding a ring - 760 entries contained “ring,” 4th, 5th, and 7th most-funny were about “not buying a ring.”</li>
        <li>Losing keys (310 entries), remote (264 entries) and phone (103 entries)</li>
        <li>References to (and double entendres) of change (287 entries)</li>
    </ul>
<p>We landed on these angles (and nearly all themes among the <a href="https://nextml.github.io/caption-contest-data2/dashboards/771.html" target="_blank">contest’s entries</a>) pretty quickly in our brainstorm with GPT-3. Since so many people submitted a caption related to “rings,” the highest ranking were the best versions with the most pithy, oh-so-smoothly-rolls-off-the-tongue phrasing.</p>
<p>Very rarely did the finalists use a unique joke angle, which means GPT-3 might be well-suited when it comes to generating the pool of joke angles. But to consistently rank in the top 100, you likely need a human to perfect the writing.</p>
<p>Mankoff, for example, took GPT-3’s output of “Don't worry, dear. It's just the magnetism of my personality" and perfected it to “I told you I had a magnetic personality.” We didn’t submit this caption, but 50 other people entered a “magnetic” joke, with “I asked them to try to find your magnetic personality.” ranking at #153.</p>
<p><i>Puns and Double Entendres</i></p>
<p>We never experimented with different figures of speech, but we were hopeful that this would be where a computer would be useful. In theory, we could take the themes of a cartoon and search pun databases for possible candidates. Very few people submit these types of captions, making them more unique and unlikely to rely on pithy writing. For example, “No, I said you've lost your mettle” ranked at #51 in the above cartoon, a pun that could have been generated by GPT-3.</p>
<p><i>Better Models</i></p>
<p>GPT-3 was an easy way to test our theory that a computer could reliably produce humor. It relies on a general natural language model, and we tried to point it in the direction of the sort of intellectual, subtle humor that’s found in the New Yorker. But that wasn’t easy: GPT-3 would tend to produce “dad jokes” if simply asked to write a funny caption for a cartoon.</p>
<p>If we were to create a model from scratch, we’d lean on <a href="http://erichorvitz.com/phumor.pdf" target="_blank">this paper</a>, which describes the different aspects of high-ranking captions, specifically focusing on the cartoon’s anomaly and caption pithiness.</p>
<p><b>The Caption Contest as a humor barometer</b></p>
<p>We started this project with the premise of wielding GPT-3 for comedy, but Pamela Mishkin, who was the project’s computational humor expert, aptly questioned this premise.</p>
<p>She pointed out that New Yorker cartoon captions aren’t actually funny, a sentiment echoed by many people, and based on the way readers ranked captions, it increasingly became clear that this contest was actually a competition in cleverness instead of laugh-out-loud humor. Indeed, very rarely would a caption finalist make us laugh. The barometer for a good caption was <i>at most</i> a chuckle, which is a pretty damn low bar for humor.</p>
<p>In short, an AI that can produce winning captions does mean we have accomplished anything in the realm of computational humor. Rather, we’ve figured out whether an AI can write New Yorker-style captions, which is an impressive feat, but not one that means we can leave joke writing to computers.</p>
