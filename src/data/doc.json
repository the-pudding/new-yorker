Comedians lament the effort that goes into producing one hour of stand-up, metaphorically called “The Gym” and literally “working out” material. Jokes that seemed brilliant on paper can fall flat in front of an audience. There is so much detail to consider and refine, like the perfect timing of a punchline. The work is a months-long feedback loop between a person and an audience—the laughs (and <a href=https://pudding.cool/2018/02/stand-up/>their duration</a>)—are their inputs. They’re perfected in small gyms (tiny comedy clubs) before they’re ready for the big stage (Netflix)."},{"type":"text","value":"To make people laugh, it isn’t as simple as telling a computer the rules of humor.
